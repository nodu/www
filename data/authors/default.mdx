I am a curious leader with a deep sense of empathy. With over 10 years of experience in software engineering, web development, and technical leadership, I excel in innovative environments. Creating something from nothing is my true passion.

I've spend over 10 years abroad, first teaching English in the middle of rice fields in Japan with JET. Then to Hong Kong working as a software engineer and senior engineering leader.

I've created several successful companies and consulted various startups over the years.

I specialize in scalable architecture using cutting-edge technologies such as AWS/Azure/GCP and Node.js/React.js, and I am passionate about creating solutions that meet the needs and expectations of our global clients. I value innovation, collaboration, and customer satisfaction, and I strive to foster a culture of excellence, agility, and diversity within the technical team and the organization as a whole. I am also a life-long learner, an avid tinkerer, and a gamer who enjoys experimenting and exploring new ideas and challenges.

I document some of my projects and interest here on this site. Take care!
