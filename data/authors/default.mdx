I am a curious leader with a strong sense of empathy, always focused on continuous improvement. With over 10 years of experience in software engineering, web development, and technical leadership, I thrive in innovative environments. Creating something from nothing is my true passion.

I have spent over 10 years abroad, first in the middle of rice fields in Japan with JET, and then in Hong Kong working as a software engineer and executive engineering leader.

I have founded several successful companies and provided consulting services to various startups over the years.

My expertise lies in building exceptional teams and products with scalable architecture using cutting-edge technologies. I am dedicated to creating solutions that meet the needs and expectations of my global clients. I prioritize innovation, collaboration, and customer satisfaction, and I work towards fostering a culture of excellence, agility, and diversity within the technical team and the organization as a whole. I am a lifelong learner, a passionate tinkerer, and a gamer who enjoys experimenting and tackling new ideas and challenges.

I share some of my projects and interests on this site. Take care!
