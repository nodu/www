While living in Hong Kong, I became actively engaged with the startup and makerspace communities. My enthusiasm for technology and collaboration led me to contribute by educating others. When the Hong Kong Mini Maker Fair was organized, I seized the opportunity to volunteer teaching a workshop on the Raspberry Pi.

The workshop aimed to introduce attendees to the Raspberry Pi and begin with fundamental Linux CLI (Command Line Interface) commands. The objective was to equip them with the skills required to effectively navigate and manage files on the system. Further on, the participants were guided to construct a basic push-button circuit. They also learned some elementary Python programming to create a simple game, five second stadium.

This form of hands-on education is my favorite, as it allows learners to quickly acquire practical abilities and apply them to real-world projects. Just in time and just enough to be dangerous!

For those interested in the workshop materials and code used during the session, they are accessible on my GitHub repository.
