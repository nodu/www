Howdy!

This June I'm participating in the AIDS/LifeCycle event, a challenging 545-mile cycle ride stretching from San Francisco to Los Angeles, which includes over 22,000 feet of elevation change. The event unfolds across seven days starting June 1st and serves as a primary fundraiser for AIDS and HIV research.

The services provided as a result of my fundraising efforts include counseling, HIV/STD screenings, linking youth experiencing homelessness and people living with HIV to housing, and so much more. By supporting this cause, you take a stand against stigma, helping to create a world where health justice is a reality for everyone.

Your donations would be immensely appreciated. You can contribute directly using this link:

However, we have an opportunity to maximize our donations: several of our friends and family members have employers that offer 2x donation matching. This means any contributions using their employer will double our donations!

If you're interested in doubling your donation (Anything helps as I'll need to raise $3,500!), please send your contributions to me via Venmo or any other convenient method. Your support is crucial, and I'm thankful for your role in aiding this vital cause. Thank you!
