Howdy!

This June I'm participating in [AIDS/LifeCycle](https://www.aidslifecycle.org), a challenging 545-mile cycle ride stretching from San Francisco to Los Angeles, with over 22,000 feet of elevation change! The event unfolds across seven days starting June 1st and serves as a primary fundraiser for AIDS and HIV research.

The services provided as a result of my fundraising efforts include counseling, HIV/STD screenings, linking youth experiencing homelessness and people living with HIV to housing, and so much more. By supporting this cause, you take a stand against stigma, helping to create a world where health justice is a reality for everyone.

Your donations would be immensely appreciated. You can contribute directly using this link:

The above donation link comes from Mae's company (PG&E) corporate match. This means any contributions using her employer will double our donations!

Anything helps as I'll need to raise $3,500!

Thanks and much love! ~ Matt
