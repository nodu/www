When I'm remote debugging systems, like kubernetes, and checking network connectivity, I often times lack efficiency because I make heavy use of aliases and functions in my CLI.

So, I created a public repository called defaults for my colleagues and citizens of the internet (you can find the repo here: www.github.com/nodu/defaults). This way, no sign in is needed to quickly get the bash helpers. This allows a very quick initialization of a remote server or new terminal and allows a lot of the syntactic sugar or keyboard magic for instant productivity and quick debugging.

I namespace a lot of these helpers under `m` as it's not a reserved keyword or command used in linux. This allows a OS 'start menu' of sorts, just type `m.`, then press 'tab' and you'll get a listing of all the helpers.

Some of the helpers will fail due to their base programs not being installed yet such as tshark, httpstat, etc. Though the movement helpers like '..' and 'srch' help tremendously.

Check it out.
