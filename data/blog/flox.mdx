Dear Flox,

I've been using NixOS for just under 3 years now, what a game changer! But man that learning curve is wild and painful.

After meeting Ron and Michael at Civo I was really energized about Flox. [Nix but with a accessible and great DevEx?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7oD_oX-Gio)
As a engineering leader, I've struggled way too many times with dev envs and their corresponding server mismatch, stale dependencies, etc etc.

Meeting Rok at SCaLE 22x really sold Flox to me, "Simple things should be simple, complex things ..."

I want to be a part of the team that brings Nix to the masses.

In no particular order:

- After living in Japan, I can teach a masterclass in Karaoke
- More than familiar with Nix, Python, Node, Go (Haven't picked up Rust yet)
- Launched 6 MVPs for Startups in Hong Kong, scaled latest company from demo to PMF (2-30 FTE CFX remote folks) #0-1 #scaling
- Managed multii-cloud as well as lead full scale migrations between AWS, GCP, Azure
- Created non functional DR/Security/Incident/Documentation systems/processes as well as paved way for SOC2 certification

I think we'd be great together, if you're curious [call me](https://youtu.be/StKVS0eI85I?t=34)!

Cheers and take care,

Matt Nodurfth
